# Hello-World
This is my first Python Project. 
In this Project i need to design a P2P RFC exchange program where all peers store their RFCs and ask Registrar Server to share detail of the peers who has other RFC so that peer1 can download RFC from there and update.
RFC should be in linked list format.
I need to use Python programming language.
